# Welcome to the Stick Bug Page

This is the source code for my pretty pointless app. Feel free to make changes to it as I am still only learning how to do this stuff. I will eventually clean it up myself.

## Features:

### Animation

It's just a Stick Bug dancing as a gif...

### Counter

The app counts how many times the song has played. Also you can find the source of this [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPPKHt6hFCA)

### Continuous playing

The Stick Bug song will continue to play even when the app is CLOSED. The only ways to close it are by hitting "MAKE IT STOP" on the notification (Notifications must be ON) or by forcing the app to stop. If the song stops for no reason, it might be because your phone needs more memory, but that shouldn't happen anyways.

### Notification

As said above, a notification pops up (should be silent) and will stay until the song is stopped. The notification will show you how many times it has played as well and will continue to update. IF you turn off the notification, the only way to stop the song is to go to the settings and force stop the app. So don't turn off the notification.

## Future Updates:

### Stick Bug and Rick Roll

Someone is finna get Rick Rolled

### Stick Bug and Distracted

Someone is finna get Distracted

## Bugs & Issues

You can keep report any Bugs or Issues within the app in the [Issues](https://github.com/gtaEPIC/Stickbug/issues) tab. Please don't create duplicates, you can search to see if the problem already exists.
